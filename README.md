# Fake-news-Project

Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tools offer great promise for researchers to build
systems which could automatically detect fake news. However,
detecting fake news is a challenging task to accomplish as it requires
models to summarize the news and compare it to the actual news in
order to classify it as fake. Moreover, the task of comparing proposed
news with the original news itself is a daunting task as it's highly
subjective and opinionated.

Motivation for the Problem Undertaken
The goal is to build a prototype to classify the news as fake or not fakes in
order to bring awareness and reduce unwanted chaos.
➔ To apply data preprocessing and preparation techniques in order to
obtain clean data.
➔ Explore the effectiveness of multiple machine learning approaches
and select the best for this problem

Several Classification models are built to predict the
label of the news i.e. whether it is fake or not. The models are evaluated
and compared to determine the one with highest performance.
In this project, the data science process starting with getting the data, then
cleaning and preprocessing the data, followed by exploring the data and
building models, then evaluating the results and communicating them with
visualizations is followed. Thus, this is a Machine Learning Approach
combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) for fake news
detection.
Finally, the Mean Validation Accuracy, so obtained, is 96.70%
